			%h3 What is Linkful?
			%p Linkful lets you share, receive and archive your links in a convenient way for everyone. Never again send emails to your friends with a bunch of links, or lose that page you need in your endless list of bookmarks. 
		.span4
			%h3 How does it work?
			%p Simply drag a link into your bookmarks bar, then click on it when you are on a page that you want to share. You will then be see a prompt asking who you would like to share that page with.

			%h3 How do I signup?
			%p Unfortunately, right now Linkful is in closed beta. But there is good news! If you have received a link, then you automatically have an account when we open for signup. You'll receive an email when we open to let you know.

			This website a product of Ryder Moody and Alex Poon. It exists because we want our mailboxes to stop being filled with 10 links in 10 different emails and because we want a more natural place to store them than in our inboxes. Seriously, please don't email either of us links ever again after registration opens. So far

			We think this is a great start, but clearly we have far to go....
